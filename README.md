# Training a GRU Model on the IMDB Dataset using Keras
This code implements a sentiment analysis model using a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural network. The model is trained on the IMDB dataset, which contains movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the code:

* numpy
* tensorflow
* keras
## Dataset
The IMDB dataset can be loaded using the imdb.load_data() function from Keras. The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

## Model Architecture
The model consists of three layers:

* Embedding layer: This layer takes the input sequences (word indices) and maps them to dense vectors of fixed size. This helps in capturing the meaning of words in a way that is more useful for the model.
* GRU layer: This layer processes the sequence of vectors generated by the embedding layer and outputs a single vector for each input sequence. The GRU has dropout and recurrent dropout to prevent overfitting.
* Dense layer: This layer takes the output vector from the GRU layer and applies a sigmoid activation function to output a probability between 0 and 1, representing the sentiment of the input review.
The model is trained using binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

## Usage
To train the model, simply run the code. The hyperparameters can be adjusted at the beginning of the code. After training, the model is evaluated on the testing set and the test loss and accuracy are printed.

To predict the sentiment of a new review, use the predict_sentiment() function. The function takes a string as input and returns a string indicating whether the sentiment is positive or negative.

## Conclusion
This code demonstrates a simple yet effective method for sentiment analysis using a GRU neural network. The model can be improved by tuning the hyperparameters or using a more advanced architecture.
